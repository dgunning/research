## Quality Thresholds

Your article should meet these minimums:

- **Average sentence length:** 15-20 words
- **Code examples:** At least one working example
- **Images:** At least one for articles >1000 words
- **Links:** At least 2-3 relevant resources
- **Reading time:** Clearly stated

## Red Flags

Stop and fix if you see:

- ❌ Any untested code example
- ❌ Broken links or 404s
- ❌ Missing prerequisites
- ❌ Unexplained jargon
- ❌ No code examples in technical post
- ❌ Very long paragraphs (>7 sentences)
- ❌ Passive voice throughout
- ❌ Multiple H1 headings
- ❌ Missing alt text on images
- ❌ Generic "click here" links

## Before You Hit Publish

Ask yourself:

1. **Would this help me?** If you were the target reader, would this solve your problem?
2. **Is it complete?** Can someone follow this start to finish?
3. **Is it accurate?** Have you verified all technical claims?
4. **Is it clear?** Can your target audience understand it?
5. **Is it original?** What unique value does this provide?
6. **Am I proud of this?** Does this represent your best work?

If you answer "no" to any of these, revise before publishing.
