## Week 3 Notes

### Common Challenges

**"I feel arrogant using strong language"**
- Confidence ≠ arrogance
- You're stating facts, not bragging
- Weak qualifiers actually hurt credibility
- Practice until it feels natural

**"SCQA feels formulaic"**
- Frameworks guide, not restrict
- Use it until structure becomes instinctive
- Then adapt naturally to situations
- Best speakers use structure unconsciously

**"Eye contact still feels uncomfortable"**
- Keep practicing - it gets easier
- Start with friendly faces in real situations
- 2-3 seconds is enough, then move on
