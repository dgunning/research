## Day 8: Projection Fundamentals

**Warmup (5 min)**:
- Diaphragmatic breathing: 10 deep breaths, hand on belly

Practice speech: Prepare 1-minute introduction about yourself
- First: Record at conversational volume
- Second: Record projecting to back of room
- Third: Record with supported projection (from diaphragm, not throat)

Compare: Does projection version lose clarity or sound shouty?

## Week 2 Notes

### Common Challenges

**"My projection sounds shouty/strained"**
- You're likely pushing from throat instead of diaphragm
- Focus on breath support from belly
- Should feel effortless, not strained
- Practice "ha" exercise to feel diaphragm engagement

**"I can't maintain pace consistently"**
- Normal - it takes practice
- Use metronome more often
- Record and count WPM regularly
- Slow down is usually safer than too fast

**"I forget the new vocabulary words"**
- Use spaced repetition (review Day 3, 10, 17, 31)
- Must use words in conversation to retain
- Write sentences using words
- Flashcard apps help (Anki, Magoosh)

**"Pausing feels awkward/creates dead air"**
- Silence feels longer to you than to audience
- 2-second pause is actually perfect
- Practice with timer to calibrate
- Watch TED talks - count their pauses

### Progress Check

By end of Week 2, you should:
- ✓ Have 10+ new vocabulary words learned
- ✓ Know your speaking pace (WPM)
- ✓ Project voice 15+ feet comfortably
- ✓ Use strategic pauses consciously
- ✓ Identify and replace weak qualifiers
- ✓ Add vocal variety naturally
- ✓ Complete 14 consecutive days of practice
