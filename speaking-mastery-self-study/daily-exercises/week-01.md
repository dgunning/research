## Week 1 Notes

### Common Challenges

**"I feel awkward recording myself"**
- Normal! Everyone feels this way at first
- The discomfort decreases rapidly
- Recording is the fastest path to improvement
- You don't have to share recordings with anyone

**"I can't find 15-30 minutes daily"**
- Start with just 5 minutes (warmup + 1 exercise)
- Practice during commute, shower, or lunch break
- Consistency matters more than duration
- Block calendar time like any important meeting

**"I'm not seeing improvement yet"**
- Week 1 is about awareness, not perfection
- Progress compounds over time
- Re-listen to Day 1 vs Day 7 - improvements are there
- Keep going - Week 2 builds on this foundation

### Tips for Success

✅ Pick same time daily for practice
✅ Create dedicated folder for recordings
✅ Use smartphone voice memos (free, easy)
✅ Practice in private space initially
✅ Be honest but kind in self-assessment
✅ Note even small improvements
✅ Apply one technique in real conversation each day

### What's Next

**Week 2** focuses on:
- Voice projection and power
- Pace control (140-170 WPM goal)
- Vocabulary expansion (10+ new words)
- Strategic pausing
- Authority language
- Vocal variety

**Prepare**: Make sure apps are downloaded, journal is ready, recording space is set up.
