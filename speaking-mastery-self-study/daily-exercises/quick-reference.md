## Authority Language Swaps

### Replace Weak Language

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "I just wanted to..." | "I'm reaching out to..." |
| "Sorry to bother you..." | "Thank you for your time..." |
| "I think maybe..." | "I recommend..." |
| "I could be wrong..." | "Based on my analysis..." |
| "Kind of like..." | "Similar to..." |
| "Does that make sense?" | "What questions do you have?" |
| "I'm no expert but..." | "From my experience..." |

### Eliminate These Qualifiers
- Just
- Maybe
- Kind of / Sort of
- I think
- Probably
- Hopefully
- Possibly
- Sorry (when unnecessary)

---

## Filler Words to Eliminate

Track and replace with pauses:
- Um, uh, ah
- Like
- You know
- So (sentence starter)
- Basically
- Actually
- Literally
- I mean

**Technique**: When you feel filler word coming:
1. Take small breath
2. Count "1" silently
3. Continue speaking

**Silence sounds more confident than "um"**
