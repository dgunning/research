# Credit Card Rewards Mastery - Canadian Edition Addendum

## Overview: Key Differences for Canadian Cardholders

The Canadian credit card landscape is fundamentally different from the US market. While many core principles remain the same (never carry balances, maximize category spending, etc.), the specific cards, issuers, rules, and strategies require significant adaptation.

**The Good News for Canadians:**
- ✅ **NO 5/24 rule** - The biggest constraint in the US doesn't exist in Canada
- ✅ More lenient application rules (except RBC)
- ✅ Easier churning opportunities with many issuers
- ✅ Strong transfer partners (Aeroplan is world-class)
- ✅ Similar tax treatment (rewards generally not taxable)

**The Challenges:**
- ❌ Smaller signup bonuses overall
- ❌ Higher annual fees relative to benefits
- ❌ Fewer premium card options
- ❌ Amex Canada enforcing "once-in-a-lifetime" more strictly
- ❌ Stricter income requirements for top-tier cards

---

## Part 1: Major Differences from US Market

### 1. No 5/24 Rule!

**This changes everything.** The entire US strategy revolves around getting Chase cards first before hitting 5/24. In Canada:
- You can apply for cards in any order
- No need to prioritize specific issuers first
- More flexibility in application timing
- Focus shifts to individual issuer rules instead

### 2. Different Major Issuers

**Canadian "Big 5" Banks + Others:**
- **RBC** (Royal Bank of Canada)
- **TD** (Toronto-Dominion)
- **CIBC** (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce)
- **Scotiabank**
- **BMO** (Bank of Montreal)
- **American Express Canada** (separate from US Amex)
- **MBNA** (now owned by TD)
- **Neo Financial** (fintech, gaining popularity)

### 3. Application Frequency Rules

Unlike the US where Chase has 5/24, Canadian banks have different constraints:

**RBC - Strict 90-Day Rule:**
- Only ONE RBC credit card per 90 days
- Automatic rejection if you apply sooner
- Very firmly enforced
- **Strategy**: Plan RBC applications carefully, space them 90+ days apart

**TD - 6-Month Cooldown on Specific Cards:**
- TD First Class Travel: Can't reapply if closed within last 6 months
- Cooldown starts from close date (not open date)
- TD Aeroplan cards: Cooldown from open date
- No overall application frequency limit

**Scotiabank - 24-Month Welcome Bonus Rule:**
- Not eligible for welcome bonus if you've had ANY Scotiabank card in past 24 months
- More restrictive than most Canadian issuers
- Can still get approved, just no bonus

**CIBC, BMO - No Strict Rules:**
- No official application frequency limits
- Use common sense (don't apply for 5 cards in a month)
- Space applications 1-3 months apart to be safe

**MBNA - Very Lenient:**
- Anecdotal: Can churn as soon as 1 month after canceling
- Recommended: Wait 3 months to be safe
- No official bonus eligibility restrictions

**Amex Canada - Once-in-a-Lifetime:**
- One welcome bonus per card, ever
- More strictly enforced than US Amex
- Separate from US Amex (different bonuses available)
- More aggressive about banning churners recently

### 4. Transfer Partners & Programs

**Aeroplan (Air Canada)**
- The crown jewel of Canadian points programs
- Star Alliance partner (28 airlines, 1,300+ airports)
- Transfer partners: Amex MR, Chase UR (from US), Capital One, Bilt, Marriott (3:1)
- Best for: International premium cabin redemptions

**RBC Avion Rewards**
- Two tiers: Avion Premium and Avion Elite
- Transfer partners (Elite only):
  - British Airways Avios (1:1)
  - Cathay Pacific Asia Miles (1:1)
  - American Airlines AAdvantage (10:7 ratio - poor)
  - WestJet Rewards (1:1, both tiers)
- Fixed-chart redemption on any airline
- Transfer time: Up to 4 weeks

**TD Rewards**
- Earn TD Points on TD cards
- Can transfer to select partners or redeem for travel
- Less flexible than Aeroplan or Avion

**Scene+ (Scotiabank + Cineplex)**
- Earn at grocery stores, gas, movies, restaurants
- Can redeem for travel, entertainment, merchandise
- Partners with Empire groceries (Sobeys, Safeway, FreshCo)

**American Express Membership Rewards (Canada)**
- Separate from US Membership Rewards
- Can transfer to Aeroplan (primary value)
- Some hotel partners
- Limited compared to US Amex MR

### 5. Tax Implications (CRA vs IRS)

**Generally NOT Taxable in Canada (Same as US):**
- Personal credit card rewards
- Cashback on personal purchases
- Points/miles earned from personal spending
- CRA treats these as discounts, not income

**Potentially TAXABLE in Canada:**

**Work-Related Rewards:**
- Using company card for work, keeping personal rewards: Potentially taxable
- Converting work-earned points to cash: Taxable
- Employer would report on T4 slip (box 14) if taxable

**Test for Work Rewards (CRA):**
Not taxable if ALL of these are true:
- Points are NOT converted to cash
- Plan is NOT alternative form of remuneration
- Plan is NOT for tax avoidance purposes

**Business Card Rewards:**
- Depends on personal vs business use
- If used for business expenses but rewards used personally: Consult accountant
- May need to track and report

**Key Difference from US:**
- US: Focus on signup bonuses with/without spend requirement
- Canada: More focus on work-related rewards scenarios
- Same result: 99% of personal card rewards not taxable

## Part 3: Canadian Churning Strategy

### The 6-Month Rule (Canadian Standard)

Unlike the US 24-month focus, Canadian churning typically follows a 6-month pattern:

**Standard Canadian Churn Cycle:**
1. Apply for card
2. Meet minimum spend (usually 3 months)
3. Keep card open for 6 months minimum
4. Cancel card
5. Wait 6 months
6. Reapply for same card
7. **Result**: Welcome bonus every 12 months

**Why 6 Months?**
- Safe timeframe to avoid issuer penalties
- Some cards (like TD) have explicit 6-month cooldowns
- Balances account age for credit score
- Industry standard among Canadian churners

### Optimal Canadian Application Order

**Without 5/24, prioritize by:**

**Tier 1 - Start Here (Hardest to Get Later):**
1. **American Express Cobalt** - Get FIRST before other Amex (once-in-a-lifetime)
2. **Scotiabank Gold Amex** - Before any Scotiabank card (24-month rule)
3. **RBC Avion Visa Infinite** - Space all RBC 90+ days apart

**Tier 2 - High Value, More Flexible:**
4. **CIBC Dividend Visa Infinite** - No strict rules, top cashback
5. **TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite** - Strong bonus, Aeroplan value
6. **Neo World Elite** - No fee, great categories

**Tier 3 - Fill Gaps:**
7. **BMO Eclipse or Ascend** - No strict frequency limits
8. **Tangerine Money-Back** - No fee, good backup
9. **MBNA Alaska or Rewards** - Easy to churn

### Issuer-Specific Strategies

**American Express Canada:**
- Get your top 2-3 Amex cards early (once-in-a-lifetime)
- Priority order: Cobalt > Gold (if grocery heavy) > Platinum (if premium benefits needed)
- Space applications 90 days apart
- DO NOT try to churn Amex - they're cracking down hard
- Amex Canada bonuses are separate from US Amex

**RBC Strategy:**
- Pick your #1 RBC card carefully
- Apply, wait 90 days minimum
- Apply for second RBC card if desired
- Don't rush RBC - the 90-day rule is strictly enforced
- Avion Infinite Privilege or Avion Infinite are best options

**Scotiabank Strategy:**
- Get ONE Scotiabank card, get the bonus
- Cancel after 6+ months
- Wait 24 months before any other Scotiabank card
- Best card: Scotiabank Gold Amex
- This 24-month rule makes Scotiabank less churn-friendly

**TD Strategy:**
- TD Aeroplan or TD First Class Travel
- If closing First Class Travel, wait 6 months before reapplying
- Can hold multiple TD cards simultaneously
- No overall frequency limit

**CIBC & BMO Strategy:**
- Most flexible Canadian banks
- No strict bonus eligibility rules
- Follow standard 6-month churn cycle
- Space applications 2-3 months apart
- Can be aggressive with these issuers

**MBNA Strategy:**
- Easiest to churn in Canada
- Wait 3 months minimum (1 month might work)
- Alaska Airlines card popular for West Coast
- Rewards Mastercard for general use

### Two-Player Mode (Canadian Couples)

**Even More Powerful in Canada:**
- No 5/24 means no coordination needed for issuer priority
- Both players can apply for same cards simultaneously
- Double all welcome bonuses
- Add each other as authorized users for benefits

**Strategy:**
- Month 1: Player 1 applies for Card A, Player 2 applies for Card B
- Month 2-3: Meet minimum spends
- Month 4: Player 1 applies for Card B, Player 2 applies for Card C
- Continuously rotate through high-value cards

**Example Annual Plan:**
- Player 1: Amex Cobalt, RBC Avion, CIBC Dividend, TD Aeroplan
- Player 2: Scotiabank Gold, BMO Eclipse, MBNA Alaska, Neo (no hard pull)
- Result: 8 welcome bonuses, full category coverage

---

## Part 4: Income Requirements

Canadian banks explicitly state minimum income requirements for premium cards:

**World Elite Mastercard:**
- Personal income: $80,000+
- Household income: $150,000+

**Visa Infinite Privilege:**
- Personal income: $200,000+
- Household income: $250,000+

**Visa Infinite:**
- Personal income: $60,000+
- Household income: $100,000+

**American Express Premium:**
- Varies by card
- Platinum: Higher income required (not publicly stated)
- Gold/Cobalt: More accessible

**Strategy Notes:**
- Canadian banks strictly verify income more than US banks
- Use household income if applicable (includes spouse/partner)
- Some banks count before-tax, others after-tax (ask)
- Self-employed: May need to provide tax returns

## Part 8: Mistakes to Avoid (Canadian-Specific)

1. **❌ Getting multiple Scotiabank cards within 24 months**
   - You won't get the welcome bonus on the second one
   - Get one, wait 24 months

2. **❌ Applying for RBC cards within 90 days**
   - Automatic denial
   - Wasted hard inquiry

3. **❌ Churning American Express Canada**
   - They're cracking down hard
   - Once-in-a-lifetime is enforced
   - Risk account closure and blacklisting

4. **❌ Ignoring income requirements**
   - Canadian banks verify income
   - Lying on application = fraud
   - Use household income if eligible

5. **❌ Not leveraging Aeroplan**
   - It's Canada's best transfer partner
   - Underutilizing Aeroplan = leaving value on table

6. **❌ Paying foreign transaction fees unnecessarily**
   - Get a no-FX card for US/travel (Scotiabank Passport, Brim, Home Trust)
   - 2.5% adds up fast

7. **❌ Forgetting product switches**
   - Sometimes get bonus, sometimes don't
   - Worth asking instead of canceling

8. **❌ Applying for same card too soon**
   - 6-month minimum after canceling
   - 12-month cycle is safest

9. **❌ Keeping high-fee cards without using benefits**
   - Fewer credits to offset fees vs US cards
   - Be ruthless about annual fee ROI

10. **❌ Assuming US strategies work in Canada**
    - Different market = different rules
    - Research Canadian-specific data points

---

## Summary: Canadian Credit Card Mastery

**Core Strategy Differences:**
1. **No 5/24** - Apply in order of value, not issuer priority
2. **Amex first** - Once-in-a-lifetime is strictly enforced
3. **6-month churn cycles** - Not 24-month like US
4. **RBC 90-day rule** - Only major hard restriction
5. **Aeroplan focus** - Best transfer partner for Canadians

**Expected Value (Annual):**
- Year 1: $1,500-2,500 CAD
- Year 2-3: $2,000-4,000 CAD
- Year 5+: $3,000-6,000 CAD (top 1% Canadian churner)

**Top Canadian Cards to Get:**
1. American Express Cobalt (5x food, must get first)
2. Scotiabank Gold Amex (6x groceries, 24-month restriction)
3. CIBC Dividend Infinite (4x gas/groceries, no restrictions)
4. RBC Avion Infinite (flexible travel, 90-day rule)
5. Neo World Elite (5x groceries, $0 fee)

**The Canadian Advantage:**
More flexibility without 5/24, easier to get started, can be more aggressive with applications—but smaller bonuses mean you need more cards to match US earnings.

**Bottom Line:**
Canadian credit card churning is **very viable** and in some ways **easier than the US** (no 5/24!), but requires understanding Canadian-specific rules and focusing on Aeroplan ecosystem for maximum value.
