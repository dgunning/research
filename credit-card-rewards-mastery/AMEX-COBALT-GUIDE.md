## Why Get This Card First (Critical!)

### Once-in-a-Lifetime Rule
- Amex Canada strictly enforces: **One welcome bonus per card, EVER**
- You cannot churn this card like other Canadian cards
- Get it early in your credit card journey
- **Get the Cobalt BEFORE any other Amex card**

### Priority Order for Amex Canada
1. **Cobalt** (if you spend on food)
2. **Gold Card** (if grocery heavy and want insurance benefits)
3. **Platinum** (if you need premium travel benefits)

Once you get one, you can never get that welcome bonus again. Choose wisely!

## Points Value & Redemption

### Amex Membership Rewards (MR) Points
The Cobalt earns Amex MR points, which transfer to partners.

### Best Redemption: Transfer to Aeroplan
- **1:1 transfer ratio** to Air Canada Aeroplan
- Aeroplan is Canada's best travel program
- Value: 1.5-2+ cents per point for travel
- Star Alliance access (28 airlines, 1,300+ airports)

### Other Options
- Fixed-point travel: 1 cent per point
- Gift cards: ~0.7 cents per point (poor value)
- Merchandise: Terrible value (avoid)

### Example Value Calculation
Spend $1,000/month on groceries:
- Earn: 5,000 MR points per month = 60,000/year
- Transfer to Aeroplan: 60,000 Aeroplan points
- Value: ~$900-1,200 in travel
- **Return: 5-6%+ on groceries** (best in Canada)

---

## Annual Fee Structure (Unique!)

### Monthly Billing ($13/month)
- Unlike most cards (billed annually)
- Total: $156/year
- **Advantage**: Cancel anytime without losing full annual fee
- No commitment to full year

### When Fee is Worth It
- Spend $200+/month on food: **Absolutely worth it**
- Spend $100-200/month on food: **Probably worth it**
- Spend <$100/month on food: **Consider no-fee alternative**

### Breakeven Analysis
- Annual fee: $156
- Need to earn: ~15,600 MR points to break even (at 1cpp)
- Required food spending: $3,120/year = $260/month at 5x
- **Most people easily exceed this**

## Welcome Bonus Strategies

### Current Offers (Check Before Applying)
- Standard: 30,000 points (spend $500/month for first 12 months)
- Enhanced: 50,000 points (varies by promotion)
- Referral: Sometimes 10,000 extra points

### Meeting the Bonus
Typical structure: Earn 2,500 points/month for 12 months

- Or: $1,500 spend/month at other categories
- Strategy: Use only for groceries/dining to hit naturally

### Don't Rush
- You have 12 months to earn the full bonus
- Spend naturally - don't overspend to hit targets

## Strategy & Optimization

### Card Pairing Strategy

**Ideal 2-Card Setup:**
1. **Amex Cobalt**: All food spending (groceries + dining)
2. **CIBC Dividend or Neo World Elite**: Gas and everything else

**Ideal 3-Card Setup:**
1. **Amex Cobalt**: Food (5x)
2. **CIBC Dividend**: Gas and groceries backup (4x)
3. **Tangerine Money-Back**: 2% in your other top categories

### Maximizing Value

**Always Use For:**
- Grocery stores (5x)
- Restaurants and bars (5x)
- Food delivery (Skip, Uber Eats, DoorDash) (5x)
- Meal kits (HelloFresh, GoodFood) (5x)
- Coffee shops (5x)

**Never Use For:**
- Non-food purchases (waste of 5x potential)
- Gas (use 3-4% gas card instead)
- Online shopping (use 2% cashback card)

**Streaming Services:**
- Link Netflix, Spotify, etc. for 3x
- Better than 1x on other cards

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I churn this card like CIBC or TD cards?
**A: NO.** Amex Canada strictly enforces once-in-a-lifetime. Get the bonus once, keep the card or cancel, but you can never get the welcome bonus again.

### Q: Is $156/year worth it?
**A: Yes, if you spend $260+/month on food.** Most households easily spend $400-800/month on groceries + dining, making this a no-brainer.

### Q: What if I already have the Amex Gold?
**A: You can still get the Cobalt** (different card), but make sure you haven't received the Cobalt bonus before. Each Amex card's welcome bonus is once-in-a-lifetime.

### Q: Can I transfer points to US frequent flyer programs?
**A: Yes!** Transfer to Aeroplan, then use Aeroplan to book on Star Alliance partners (United, Air Canada, Lufthansa, etc.).

### Q: What's the minimum income requirement?
**A: Amex doesn't publish it**, but generally easier than World Elite cards. $50,000+ personal income should be sufficient for approval.

### Q: Does it have foreign transaction fees?
**A: Yes, 2.5% FX fee.** Don't use abroad. Get a no-FX card (Scotiabank Passport, Brim, Home Trust) for travel.

### Q: Can I product switch from another Amex card?
**A: No welcome bonus if you product switch.** Only new applications get the welcome bonus, and only if you've never had the Cobalt before.
