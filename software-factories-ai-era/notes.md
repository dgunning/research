# Software Factories in the AI Era - Research Notes

## Original Prompt

> I am interested in the topic of software factories. Research the idea of software factories, then put it in the context of the current day with AI and ai coding assistance. At the end of the research I must be very knowledgeable about software factories and can explain it as an ai lead to VP, managers or developers at my target workplaces

## Research Goals

1. Understand the historical concept of software factories
2. Study the evolution from original concept to modern implementations
3. Analyze how AI and AI coding assistance embody software factory principles
4. Prepare explanations for different audiences:
   - VPs: Business value, ROI, competitive advantage
   - Managers: Strategic implementation, team transformation
   - Developers: Technical details, practical application

## Research Log

### Session Start: 2025-11-07

#### Research Strategy
1. Historical software factory concept (Microsoft, Greenfield)
2. Software product lines and domain engineering
3. Modern AI coding assistants as software factories
4. Low-code/no-code platforms
5. Industrialization of software development
6. Practical implementations (Copilot, Claude Code, etc.)
7. Future trends and implications
