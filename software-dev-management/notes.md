## Notes

### Session Started: 2025-11-22

#### Core Leadership Skills Research
- Emotional intelligence tops the list for technical leadership
- Technical know-how combined with managing human emotions is critical
- Trust building is fundamental before influencing responsibilities
- Active listening and open communication create team safety
- Empathy and preventing burnout are key management skills

#### Technical Competencies
- Proficiency in programming languages (Java, C#, Python, JavaScript)
- Software architecture and design principles
- Cloud technologies (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- Agile methodologies and DevOps practices
- CI/CD pipelines and automation
- Cybersecurity awareness (31% of companies investing heavily)

#### Staying Current
- Attend conferences and industry events
- Read industry publications regularly
- Participate in professional networks
- Pursue certifications (CSM, PMP)
- Technology changes monthly - continuous learning essential
- Stay on top of emerging front-end and back-end technologies

#### People Management Best Practices
- Three P Model: People, Process, Purpose
- Delegate effectively by communicating priorities
- Empower team to make decisions without fear of failure
- Take responsibility when things fail
- Build team culture through trust
- Prevent burnout through observation and intervention

#### Agile & Scrum Methodologies
- 97% of organizations now using Agile methods
- Scrum based on transparency, inspection, and adaptation
- Being agile is a mindset for the entire organization
- Leaders need coaching to develop agile mindsets
- Future is about building organizations that deliver value while maintaining technical excellence

#### Hiring Best Practices
- Blind hiring practices result in 46% more diverse hiring
- Top candidates search for just 10 weeks - move quickly
- Train interviewers in unconscious bias and inclusive techniques
- Create positive candidate experience - avoid last-minute changes
- Use STAR technique for behavioral assessment
- Assess continuous learning mindset
- Soft skills (communication, teamwork, problem-solving) as important as coding

#### Engineering Metrics & KPIs
- DORA metrics: deployment frequency, lead time, mean time to recovery
- On-time delivery rate
- Team velocity for sprint planning
- Code quality metrics
- Team satisfaction and efficiency
- Use metrics for improvement, not punishment
- Balance quantitative and qualitative indicators
- Avoid vanity metrics: story points shipped, lines of code

#### Communication & Stakeholder Management
- Adjust communication based on stakeholder's role and expertise
- High-interest, high-influence: manager, tech lead, PM, designers, executives
- Convert tech updates to business outcome reports for C-level
- Be concise with executives
- Proactively communicate changes
- Over-communicate to avoid team uncertainty

#### One-on-Ones & Performance Reviews
- Use Radical Candor method over sandwich method
- Reviews should bring no surprises - continuous feedback essential
- Weekly/biweekly one-on-ones preferred over annual reviews
- Include project documentation, peer reviews, self-assessments
- Provide specific, example-driven feedback
- Avoid generic statements - use facts and measurable improvements

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Doing too much technical work - coding vs. leadership mindset
2. Neglecting one-on-ones or turning them into status reports
3. Not seeking feedback from team and peers
4. Poor communication - need to over-communicate
5. Avoiding difficult feedback - address bad work immediately
6. Micromanaging - let people make mistakes with checkpoints
7. Lack of empathy - especially important for engineers

#### Career Development & Mentoring
- Mentoring: share experience for engineers to leverage
- Coaching: ask questions to help engineers reach solutions
- Sponsorship: champion who opens doors and provides opportunities
- Employees in mentorship programs 6x more likely to be promoted
- Google's 'Build Your Future' program example
- Use Roles & Responsibilities matrices for clear expectations

#### Team Culture & Psychological Safety
- 72% of engineering teams now fully distributed
- Teams with high psychological safety: 43% higher deployment frequency, 65% faster MTTR
- Google Project Aristotle: co-location doesn't impact performance if psychological safety exists
- Remote teams need deliberate effort for culture building
- Fewer spontaneous conversations require intentional connection
- Rethink communication and expectation management for remote teams

#### Project Estimation & Roadmap Planning
- 66% of software projects have cost overruns (McKinsey)
- For roadmaps, estimate quarters not person-hours
- Use Fibonacci numbering or "shirt sizes" for rough estimation
- Work breakdown structure (WBS) for task hierarchy
- Planning poker for effort assessment
- Planning phase = 40% of estimation
- Incorporate buffer time and track progress regularly
