## Major Case Studies Researched

### 1. Mid-20th Century Planned Capitals

#### Brasília, Brazil (1956-1960)
- **Built**: In just 41 months, inaugurated April 21, 1960
- **Designer**: Oscar Niemeyer (architecture), Lucio Costa (urban plan)
- **Population goal**: Capital city for Brazil
- **UNESCO Status**: Inscribed 1987
- **Success factors**:
  - Stunning modernist architecture
  - Successful relocation of capital from Rio de Janeiro
  - Achieved symbolic/political goals
- **Failures/Challenges**:
  - Not very dense center, outskirts grow freely without planning
  - Designed from top-down, residents reject rigid structures over time
  - Failed to conquer public space for social encounters
  - Standardization proved inhuman and disorienting (Witold Rybczynski)
  - Emphasis on aesthetics over functionality
  - Poor accessibility and inadequate public transportation

#### Chandigarh, India (1950s)
- **Designer**: Le Corbusier
- **Population**: Capital of Punjab and Haryana states
- **Success factors**:
  - Successfully serves administrative function as dual-state capital
  - Achieved goal of better environmental conditions for residents
- **Failures/Challenges**:
  - Similar to Brasília - abstract top-down planning
  - Failed to reach lofty goals
  - Standardization inhuman and disorienting
  - Open spaces inhospitable
  - Plan socially destructive

**Key Lesson**: Both cities exemplify "Radiant City" concept failures - wherever tried, it failed due to standardization, inhospitable spaces, and social destruction.

### 2. UK New Towns Movement (1946-1970s)

#### Context and Origins
- **Legal basis**: New Towns Act 1946
- **Inspiration**: Ebenezer Howard's Garden City concept (1898)
- **Early examples**: Letchworth (1903), Welwyn Garden City (1920)
- **Post-WWII driver**: Relocate people from bombed/poor housing

#### Goals
- Remedy overcrowding and congestion
- Organize scattered ad hoc settlements
- Abercrombie Plan (1944): Proposed 8 new towns around London
- Greater London Plan: Displace over 1 million people into satellites

#### Milton Keynes (Designated 1967)
- **Target population**: 250,000
- **Scale**: Largest new town, first "new city"
- **Location**: Between Birmingham and London
- **Approach**: Incorporated existing settlements

#### Overall Assessment
- Of 11 New Towns (1946-1955), 8 were London 'overspill' towns
- More successful than many other planned city experiments
- Evolutionary approach proved more sustainable

### 3. Chinese Ghost Cities (2000s-2010s)

#### Ordos Kangbashi, Inner Mongolia
- **Launched**: Early 2000s
- **Investment**: Over $1 billion
- **Target**: 1 million residents
- **Reality (2009)**: Only ~20,000 residents
- **Failures**:
  - High real estate prices deterred residents
  - Property prices plunged from $3,000/m² to $470/m²
  - Many developers went bankrupt
  - Overbuilding and economic miscalculation
  - Complete failure to attract people initially

#### Evolution/Debate
- **2017**: Population increased from 30,000 to 153,000
- **2021**: Bloomberg reported many "ghost cities" including Ordos beginning to "stir to life"
- **Criticism of term**: Wade Shepard argued "ghost city" label too focused on short-term results
- **Key insight**: Long-term planning horizons may require decades to evaluate success
