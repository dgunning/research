## Funding Strategy

### Bootstrap vs. Venture Capital

**Recommendation:** Bootstrap initially, consider VC later

**Rationale:**
- Professional services can be profitable quickly
- No need for large upfront capital
- Maintain control & flexibility
- Prove model before raising
- Better valuation later if needed

### Bootstrap Path

**Initial Capital Required:** $250K-$500K

**Sources:**
- Founder savings/personal capital
- Friends & family round
- Early customer deposits (30-50% upfront)
- Small business loan or line of credit

**Milestones:**
- Month 3: First customer project
- Month 6: Break-even
- Month 12: $2M+ revenue run rate
- Month 18: Profitable, sustainable growth

**Decision Point (Month 18-24):**
- Achieving targets? Continue bootstrapping
- Want to accelerate? Consider VC
- Building platform/product? Likely need VC

### Potential VC Path (Optional, Year 2-3)

**If pursuing VC:**
- Seed round: $2-4M at ~$10-15M pre-money valuation
- Use of funds: Product development, sales team expansion, marketing
- Target: Accelerate to $20M+ ARR in 2-3 years
- Requires shift to more product focus (less services)

**Considerations:**
- Dilution (~20-30%)
- Board seat / loss of control
- Growth expectations (3-5x year over year)
- Exit pressure (acquisition or IPO path)

**Alternative:** Profitability & organic growth often better for founders in consulting/services

## Exit Scenarios (5-7 Year Horizon)

### Scenario 1: Strategic Acquisition

**Potential Acquirers:**
- Financial data platforms (Bloomberg, FactSet, Refinitiv)
- Financial software companies (Workiva, etc.)
- Large consulting firms (Accenture, Deloitte)
- Cloud providers (AWS, GCP)

**Typical Valuation Multiples:**
- Services business: 2-4x revenue
- If SaaS/product component: 6-10x ARR
- Hybrid: Blended multiple

**Example (Year 5):**
- Revenue: $20M ($10M services, $10M recurring product)
- Valuation: $60-100M
- Founder stake (if bootstrapped): 70-80% = $42-80M

### Scenario 2: Private Equity Recap

**Structure:**
- PE firm buys 60-80% of company
- Founder retains 20-40% and stays on
- Second bite of the apple in 5-7 years

**Valuation:** Similar to strategic, maybe slight discount

**Pros:**
- Liquidity for founder
- Continued upside
- Growth capital
- Professional management support

### Scenario 3: Lifestyle Business / Hold

**Approach:**
- Maintain profitable, growing business
- Focus on quality of life
