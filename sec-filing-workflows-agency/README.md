                                          ↓
                                  edgartools Processing
                                          ↓
                        ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
                        ↓                 ↓                 ↓
                   Results          Error Log        Progress Tracking

### edgartools Integration Best Practices

#### 1. Rate Limiting & Caching

**Best Practice:** Respect SEC rate limits and cache aggressively

```python
from edgartools import Filing
import boto3
import time

def fetch_with_cache_and_retry(accession_number, s3_bucket, max_retries=3):
    """Fetch filing with S3 caching and retry logic."""

    # Try cache first
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    cache_key = f"filings/{accession_number}.json"

    try:
        obj = s3.get_object(Bucket=s3_bucket, Key=cache_key)
        return json.loads(obj['Body'].read())
    except s3.exceptions.NoSuchKey:
        pass  # Not in cache, fetch from SEC

    # Fetch from SEC with retry
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            filing = Filing(accession_number)
            data = filing.to_json()

            # Cache for future use
            s3.put_object(
                Bucket=s3_bucket,
                Key=cache_key,
                Body=json.dumps(data)
            )
            return data

        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
            else:
                raise
```

#### 2. Efficient Batch Processing

**Best Practice:** Process in batches with parallelization

```python
from edgartools import Company
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
import pandas as pd

def batch_process_companies(tickers, year, max_workers=5):
    """Process multiple companies in parallel."""

    def process_company(ticker):
        try:
            company = Company(ticker)
            filings = company.get_filings(form='10-K', year=year)

            results = []
            for filing in filings:
                financials = filing.financials()
                results.append({
                    'ticker': ticker,
                    'filing_date': filing.filing_date,
                    'financials': financials
                })
            return results

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing {ticker}: {e}")
            return []

    all_results = []

    # Parallel processing with controlled concurrency
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
        futures = {executor.submit(process_company, ticker): ticker
                   for ticker in tickers}

        for future in as_completed(futures):
            results = future.result()
            all_results.extend(results)

    return pd.DataFrame(all_results)
```

#### 3. Text Chunking for LLMs

**Best Practice:** Use edgartools' built-in chunking for AI processing

```python
from edgartools import Filing

def prepare_for_llm_analysis(accession_number, chunk_size=4000):
    """Prepare filing text for LLM with metadata."""

    filing = Filing(accession_number)

    # Use edgartools' smart chunking
    chunks = filing.text_chunks(max_size=chunk_size)

    # Enrich chunks with metadata for context
    enriched_chunks = []
    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        enriched_chunks.append({
            'chunk_id': i,
            'text': chunk,
            'filing_date': filing.filing_date.isoformat(),
            'company': filing.company,
            'cik': filing.cik,
            'form_type': filing.form_type,
            'accession_number': accession_number,
        })

    return enriched_chunks
```

### AI Agent Design Principles

#### 1. Single Responsibility
Each agent should have one clear, well-defined purpose. This enables easier testing, debugging, and reuse.

**Example:**
- ✅ **SEC Filing Agent:** Retrieve and parse SEC filings only
- ✅ **Financial Analysis Agent:** Process financial statements only
- ❌ **Everything Agent:** Does SEC retrieval, analysis, and recommendations

#### 2. Stateless Where Possible
Agents should be stateless to enable easy scaling, simpler debugging, and better testability. State management handled by orchestrator (LangGraph).

#### 3. Compliance-First
Every AI interaction must be fully auditable and traceable:
- **Log:** Full context (inputs, prompts, outputs)
- **Validate:** Check outputs for accuracy and format
- **Trace:** Source data lineage
- **Explain:** Enable explainability for regulators

#### 4. Graceful Degradation
Workflows should handle AI failures gracefully:
- **Fallback:** Revert to traditional methods if AI fails
- **Escalation:** Human review path for uncertain results
- **Retry:** Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Logging:** Clear error messages and debugging info

#### 5. Human-in-the-Loop
Critical decisions require human review:
- Investment recommendations
- Risk assessments affecting capital allocation
- Regulatory disclosures
- Novel scenarios outside training distribution

### Decision Matrix: AI vs. Non-AI

| Use Case | AI Recommended | Approach | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Extract structured financials from XBRL | No | edgartools XBRL parsing | Deterministic, reliable, no ambiguity |
| Calculate financial ratios | No | Python/pandas | Simple math, no judgment needed |
| Data validation | No | Rules-based checks | Deterministic logic preferred |
| Generate filing alerts | No | Rule-based engine | Reliability and speed critical |
| Summarize MD&A section | Yes | LLM (Claude) | Natural language understanding required |
| Compare risk factors across companies | Yes | LLM + vector search | Semantic understanding needed |
| Identify unusual patterns in financials | Yes | LLM for reasoning | Context and judgment valuable |
| Generate due diligence report | Yes | Multi-agent | Synthesis across sources |
| Extract specific disclosure | Maybe | Hybrid (rules + AI fallback) | Try deterministic first, AI if needed |

### Technology Decision: LLM Model Selection

| Task Type | Recommended Model | Rationale |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Long document analysis (10-K, 10-Q) | Claude Sonnet | Large context window (200K tokens), good reasoning |
| Quick extraction tasks | GPT-4 Turbo | Fast, cost-effective for simple tasks |
| Complex multi-step reasoning | Claude Opus | Best reasoning capabilities, worth premium for high-value |
| Batch processing (cost-sensitive) | GPT-3.5 Turbo | Most cost-effective for simpler tasks |
| Agent orchestration | Claude Sonnet | Reliable tool use, good balance of capability and cost |
| Structured data extraction | GPT-4 with JSON mode | Strong structured output support |

4. **Error Handling:** Graceful failure handling per company
5. **Data Validation:** Range checks and completeness validation
6. **Audit Trail:** Full metadata and lineage tracking

**Code Highlights:**

```python
class FinancialStatementETL:
    """Extract, transform, and load financial statements from SEC filings."""

    def extract(self, ticker: str, year: int) -> List[Filing]:
        """Extract 10-K filings for a company and year."""
        company = Company(ticker)
        filings = company.get_filings(form='10-K', year=year)
        return list(filings)

    def transform(self, filing: Filing) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Transform filing into structured financial data."""
        financials = filing.financials()

        # Extract key metrics from XBRL
        record = {
            'ticker': filing.company,
            'filing_date': filing.filing_date,
            'revenue': self._get_metric(income_statement, 'Revenues'),
            'net_income': self._get_metric(income_statement, 'NetIncome'),
            # ... more metrics
        }

        # Calculate derived metrics
        record['profit_margin'] = record['net_income'] / record['revenue']

        return record

    def load(self, records: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> None:
        """Load transformed records into data warehouse."""
        df = pd.DataFrame(records)
        # In production: df.to_sql('financial_statements', engine)
        df.to_csv(output_file)
```

**When to Use This Pattern:**
- Regular reporting needs (monthly/quarterly)
- Historical data analysis and backtesting
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Cost-sensitive operations (no LLM costs)

```python
# Data Models for Structured Output
class RiskCategory(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="Risk category name")
    severity: str = Field(description="Severity: Low, Medium, High, Critical")
    summary: str = Field(description="Brief summary of the risk")
    key_points: List[str] = Field(description="Key specific risk factors")

class RiskAnalysis(BaseModel):
    ticker: str
    filing_date: str
    categories: List[RiskCategory]
    overall_assessment: str
    year_over_year_changes: Optional[str] = None

# AI Analysis
def analyze_risks(self, ticker: str, year: int) -> RiskAnalysis:
    """Analyze risk factors using AI."""

    # Extract risk section with edgartools
    filing = self.get_filing(ticker, year)
    risk_text = self.extract_risk_section(filing)

    # Analyze with Claude
    prompt = f"""Analyze the risk factors section below...
    {risk_text}

    Categorize risks, assess severity, and provide structured analysis...
    """

    response = self.client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        max_tokens=4000,
        temperature=0.0,  # Deterministic for consistency
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )

    # Parse and validate structured output
    analysis = RiskAnalysis(**json.loads(response_text))

    # Create audit log
    self.audit_logs.append(AuditLog(
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
        model_used="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        prompt_tokens=response.usage.input_tokens,
        completion_tokens=response.usage.output_tokens,
        total_cost=self._calculate_cost(response.usage),
        analysis=analysis
    ))

    return analysis
```

**When to Use This Pattern:**

**When to Use This Pattern:**
- Complex analysis requiring multiple perspectives
- Need to combine multiple data sources
- High-value decisions (M&A, major investments)
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Synthesis and reasoning across domains

**Typical ROI:**
- Time savings: 2-3 weeks → 2-3 hours
- Cost: $10-20 per analysis (API costs)
- Value: $50K-$100K saved per deal
- Quality: More comprehensive than manual (no missed sources)

### Running the Examples

All examples are self-contained and use uv for dependency management:

```bash
# Example 1: Classic ETL (no API key needed)
uv run example_classic_etl.py

# Example 2: AI Risk Analysis (requires Anthropic API key)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key-here'
uv run example_ai_risk_analysis.py

# Example 3: Multi-Agent (requires Anthropic API key)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key-here'
uv run example_multi_agent.py
```

### Choosing the Right Pattern

| Requirement | Recommended Pattern |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Regular scheduled reporting | Classic ETL |
| Real-time notifications | Real-Time Alert |
| Natural language analysis | AI-Augmented |
| Complex multi-source synthesis | Multi-Agent |
| High-volume batch processing | Batch Processing |
| Cost-sensitive operations | Classic ETL or Batch |
| Time-sensitive decisions | Real-Time Alert |
| High-stakes decisions | Multi-Agent + Human Review |
| Compliance-heavy | Multi-Agent (with Compliance Gateway) |
| Simple data extraction | Classic ETL |

### Cost Comparison

**Processing 100 Companies (Annual 10-K Analysis):**

| Pattern | Infrastructure Cost | AI API Cost | Total Cost | Time |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|------------|------|
| Classic ETL | $50/month | $0 | $50/month | 2 hours (automated) |
| AI Risk Analysis | $50/month | $100-200 | $150-250/month | 10 minutes (automated) |
| Multi-Agent | $100/month | $1,000-2,000 | $1,100-2,100/month | 30 minutes (automated) |
| Manual Process | $0 | $0 | ~$10,000/month (labor) | 200 hours (manual) |

The patterns scale in cost and capability, but all provide dramatic time savings compared to manual processes.

### Customization & Extension

All example workflows are designed to be extended:

1. **Add New Data Sources:** Integrate news APIs, market data, etc.
2. **Custom Agents:** Add domain-specific agents (industry analysis, ESG, etc.)
3. **Different Filing Types:** Adapt to 8-K, proxy statements, S-1, etc.
4. **Output Formats:** Generate PDFs, dashboards, API responses
5. **Integration:** Connect to existing data warehouses, BI tools
6. **Alerting:** Add custom notification channels (Teams, PagerDuty, etc.)

These examples serve as starting points. SecFlow Design Agency would customize and extend these patterns based on specific client needs and use cases.
