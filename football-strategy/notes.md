# American Football Strategy Research Notes

## Project Goal
Research American football offenses, defenses, plays, routes, and strategy to develop deep knowledge beyond basic rules.

## Research Progress

### Session Started: 2025-11-22

#### Initial Setup
- Created football-strategy folder
- Beginning comprehensive research on offensive and defensive strategies

#### Offensive Formations Research
- I-formation: Classic power running setup with QB under center, FB and TB aligned behind
- Shotgun: QB 5-7 yards back, dominant modern formation especially with spread concepts
- Pistol: QB 4 yards back (closer than shotgun), RB behind QB - popular for RPOs (Ravens with Lamar Jackson)
- Spread: Designed to create space with multiple WRs, typically from shotgun

#### Route Tree and Passing Concepts
- Route tree numbered 0-9, even numbers break inside, odd numbers break outside (except 9 - go route)
- Key individual routes: flat (1), slant (2), go/fly (9)
- Passing concepts that combine routes:
  - Mesh: Two crossing routes creating traffic vs man coverage
  - Flood: Three routes at different depths on one side to overload zones
  - Levels: Layered crossing routes at different depths (high-low concept)
  - Spacing: Three-route combo with flat, spot, and hook routes

#### Defensive Formations and Coverages
- 4-3 Defense: Four down linemen, three LBs - balanced, good vs run
- 3-4 Defense: Three linemen, four LBs - emphasis on speed and flexibility
- Nickel Defense: Five DBs (used 65%+ of snaps league-wide, Bills use 80%+)
- Dime Defense: Six DBs for obvious passing situations

Coverage schemes (number = deep defenders):
- Cover 1: One deep safety, rest in man (MOFC - middle of field closed)
- Cover 2: Two deep safeties splitting field in half, corners play closer
- Cover 3: Three deep defenders each covering 1/3, better vs run and short passes
- Cover 4 (Quarters): Four deep zones, very conservative against deep passes

#### Blocking Schemes
- Zone Blocking: OL blocks areas/gaps not specific men, all move together in one direction
  - Originated with 1990s Broncos, requires backs with vision and cutback ability
  - If guard doesn't pull = zone blocking
- Gap/Power Blocking: OL blocks away from play direction, blocker pulls from backside
  - Creates numbers advantage at point of attack
  - If guard pulls = gap/angle blocking
- Man Blocking: Each lineman blocks assigned defender in predetermined gap

#### RPO (Run-Pass Option)
- QB reads specific defender post-snap to decide: handoff, pass, or keep
- Different from read-option: QB can throw play-action pass to designed route
- NFL more restricted than college due to ineligible man downfield rules
- Linemen must block like it's a run, QB must throw quickly before they get 1+ yard downfield
- Forces defenders into impossible choices

#### Modern Analytics
- EPA (Expected Points Added): Measures how much a play changes expected points
- DVOA: Compares play success to league average, adjusts for situation
- Success Rate: Based on down/distance (1st: 45% of yards, 2nd: 60%, 3rd/4th: first down)
- These metrics increasingly drive NFL decision-making in 2025

#### Pre-Snap Motion Trends (2024-2025)
- Explosive growth: 2017 no team used motion-at-snap >10%, 2024 average 25%
- LA Rams led NFL at 76.7% motion rate in 2024
- Massive statistical impact: With motion, completion % jumps from 63.6% to 66.8%, passer rating from 90.32 to 94.24
- When target was in motion: 75.1% completion, 100.11 passer rating
- NFL using AI models to classify motion types: fly, jet, glide, orbit, exit
- Purpose: Identify defensive assignments, change coverage matchups

#### Pass Rush Techniques
- Individual moves: rip, swim, bull rush, spin move
- Stunts/Twists: Defenders switch positions at snap to engage different blockers (LA Rams most effective)
- Blitzes: 5+ rushers instead of normal 3-4
  - Zone blitz: LB rushes, DL drops into coverage
  - Fire zone: 5 rush, 6 play zone
  - Cover 0 (zero blitz): Maximum rushers, no deep safety help

#### Personnel Groupings (First digit = RBs, Second digit = TEs)
- 11 Personnel: 1 RB, 1 TE, 3 WRs - Most common in NFL, offers flexibility
- 12 Personnel: 1 RB, 2 TEs, 2 WRs - Run-heavy (Ravens, Seahawks), replacing 21 as power formation
- 21 Personnel: 2 RBs, 1 TE, 2 WRs - Distant third, allows various runs, play-action, standard passes
- 22 Personnel: 2 RBs, 2 TEs, 1 WR - Almost always run, used on goal line/short yardage
- WR count is inferred (11 total players minus 5 OL, 1 QB, RBs, TEs)

#### Red Zone Strategy
- Red Zone = 20-yard line to goal line
- Subdivisions: High Red (+25 to +15), Low Red (+14 to +5), Goal Line (+4 to end zone)
- Field compression: Defenders crammed into smaller space, more Cover 0 and Cover 1
- Strategy: High-percentage plays, execution over complexity, carry over what offense already does
- Common concepts: Four verticals from 3x1, Double Smash-7, crossing/mesh routes
- Goal line: Focus on vertical push not lateral movement, play-action from Jumbo (3TE-2RB) very effective

#### Two-Minute Drill and Clock Management
- Focus on maximizing plays before half/game expires
- Tend to pass rather than run, pass near sidelines to stop clock
- Use combination of hurry-up plays, spiking football (sacrificing down), and timeouts
- 2024 season: 18 games where trailing team won in final 2 minutes (avg 22 per season this century)
- Different from no-huddle: Two-minute drill is clock-management specific, no-huddle can be used anytime

#### Audibles and Hot Routes
- Audible: QB changes play at line after reading defense
- Based on front seven looks, can change run to pass, flip direction, or adjust protection
- Famous examples: Peyton Manning's "Omaha", modern QBs like Mahomes, Allen, Burrow
- Hot Route: Receiver adjusts to shorter route (slant/screen) when QB sees blitz
- Gives QB quick release to avoid sack when defense brings extra pressure

#### Offensive Systems (Communication Philosophies)
- West Coast (Bill Walsh, 49ers): Memory system, emphasis on horizontal passing
  - Plays called by primary receiver's route (Z-In, X-Hook), others memorize tasks
- Air Coryell (San Diego Chargers 1978-86): Numerical route tree system
  - Example: "863 H-Texas F-Curl" tells each receiver their route number
- Erhardt-Perkins (Patriots): Concept-based naming
  - Plays named for concepts, not individual routes
  - Same concept can be called from any formation
  - Allows efficient one or two-word calls, perfect for no-huddle/hurry-up
  - Patriots built to communicate efficiently at tempo

#### Famous Defensive Schemes
- Tampa 2 (Tony Dungy, Monte Kiffin, Buccaneers):
  - 4-3 alignment, "bend-but-don't-break" philosophy
  - Cover 2 with MLB dropping to deep middle on pass (creating Cover 3)
  - Emphasizes speed over size at all positions
- Seattle Cover 3 (Pete Carroll, Dan Quinn):
  - Based on 4-3 under front, led NFL in total defense 2013-14
  - True Cover 3 with safety coming down to LB depth
  - Eight men close to line of scrimmage
  - Emphasizes SIZE of defensive backs (opposite of Tampa 2)

#### Key Terminology
- Play Action: Fake handoff to RB before passing
- Bootleg: QB runs parallel to line toward sideline, often with play-action
  - Naked bootleg/waggle: QB runs without blocker protection
  - QB reads flat zone first, then progresses inside
- QB Progressions: Sequential reads - primary target (first read), then secondary options
- Reading the defense: QB identifies coverage/pressure pre-snap to determine best option
