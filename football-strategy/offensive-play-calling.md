# Modern NFL Offensive Play Calling: The Erhardt-Perkins System

## Introduction

Modern NFL offenses face a critical challenge: how to communicate complex play designs quickly and efficiently, especially in no-huddle situations. The Erhardt-Perkins (E-P) system has emerged as the dominant play-calling methodology because it solves this problem better than any other approach. Unlike traditional systems that require extensive verbiage, Erhardt-Perkins uses concept-based naming that allows one or two-word play calls while maintaining maximum flexibility across formations and personnel.

This document explains how the Erhardt-Perkins system works, how it compares to other systems, and provides practical examples of how NFL teams implement it.

## The Three NFL Play-Calling Systems

All NFL teams run essentially the same plays—power runs, inside zone, mesh concepts, four verticals, etc. What differentiates teams is **how they communicate** these plays. There are three main systems:

### 1. West Coast Offense (Memory System)
**Origin:** Bill Walsh, Cincinnati Bengals (1970s), perfected with San Francisco 49ers (1979-88)

**How it works:** Plays are called by the primary receiver's route. Example: "Z-In" or "X-Hook"

**Requirements:** Players must memorize what everyone else does based on the primary route called

**Typical play call:** "Right 22 Z-In"
- Right = formation
- 22 = protection scheme
- Z-In = tells the Z receiver to run an in-route; everyone else knows their assignment based on this

**Limitation:** Extensive memorization required; slower communication

### 2. Air Coryell (Route Tree System)
**Origin:** Don Coryell, San Diego Chargers (1978-86)

**How it works:** Uses the numerical route tree to tell each receiver their specific route

**Typical play call:** "863 H-Texas F-Curl"
- 8 = Outside WR runs route 8 (post)
- 6 = Middle WR runs route 6 (in)
- 3 = Slot WR runs route 3 (comeback)
- H-Texas = H-back runs "Texas" route
- F-Curl = F-back runs curl route

**Innovation:** Popularized the route tree numbering system now universal in football

**Limitation:** Long play calls; difficult to communicate quickly

### 3. Erhardt-Perkins (Concept System)
**Origin:** Ron Erhardt and Ray Perkins, New England Patriots (1970s)

**How it works:** Plays are organized by concepts, not individual routes or formations

**Typical play call:** "Ghost" or "Mesh" or "Y-Sail"

**Key advantage:** Same concept can be run from ANY formation or personnel grouping

**Modern masters:** Bill Belichick's Patriots (2000-2023), multiple current NFL teams

---

## Why Erhardt-Perkins Dominates Modern Football

### Communication Efficiency

**The Critical Difference:** No team using Coryell or true West Coast systems can adapt as efficiently to up-tempo no-huddle offense because they simply can't communicate fast enough.

**Erhardt-Perkins advantage:** One or two-word play calls allow quarterbacks to change plays at the line of scrimmage in seconds.

**Example from Tom Brady's Patriots:**
- Brady could call "ICE!" to his left or "PAR!" to his right to create complete plays instantly
- "Circus/Kings" = full offensive play concept in two words

### Formation Flexibility

**Core principle:** In E-P, plays are named for what they accomplish (the concept), not for specific routes or formations.

**What this means:** The same "Ghost" concept works in:
- 11 personnel (1 RB, 1 TE, 3 WR)
- 12 personnel (1 RB, 2 TE, 2 WR)
- 21 personnel (2 RB, 1 TE, 2 WR)
- Shotgun, pistol, or under center
- Trips, doubles, or any receiver alignment

**Who does what changes based on formation, but the theory and tactics remain the same.**

### Cognitive Load Reduction

**Traditional systems:** Receivers must memorize dozens or hundreds of specific plays

**Erhardt-Perkins:** Players learn 15-20 core concepts that can be deployed from any look

**Result:** Faster learning curve, especially for new players or complex game plans

### Pre-Snap Adjustments

The Patriots' modified Erhardt-Perkins system prioritized quarterback-centric flexibility through concept-based play-calling rather than rigid route trees. This allows:

- Quick audibles based on defensive alignment
- Formation shifts without changing the underlying concept
- Motion to identify coverage while maintaining play integrity

---

## How the System Works

### The Foundation: Concepts, Not Plays

**Traditional thinking:** "We have 100 different plays"

**Erhardt-Perkins thinking:** "We have 20 concepts we can run from 100 different looks"

### Key Terminology

**Concept:** A coordinated pattern of routes or blocking assignments designed to attack specific defensive vulnerabilities

**Tag:** Modifier that adjusts the concept (example: "Ghost-Alert" might change protection)

**Formation call:** Separate from the concept; tells players where to align

### The Play Call Hierarchy

A complete E-P play call typically has 2-4 parts:

1. **Formation** (optional if already set)
2. **Concept name** (the core call)
3. **Tag/modifier** (optional adjustment)
4. **Cadence** (snap count)

**Example:** "Deuce Left Mesh"
- **Deuce** = Formation (2×2 receiver alignment)
- **Left** = Running back alignment
- **Mesh** = The concept (inside receivers run crossing routes, outside receivers run vertical routes)

---

## Concept Examples

Here are real Erhardt-Perkins concepts used in the NFL:

### "Ghost" - Three Levels Flood
**The concept:**
- Outside receiver: Vertical/fly route (clear out deep)
- Middle receiver: 8-yard out route (intermediate option)
- Inside receiver: Flat route (immediate option)

**QB read:** High to low, or outside to inside depending on coverage

**Why it works:** Creates vertical stretch on one side; works vs. both zone and man

**Formation flexibility:** Works from any 3-receiver set regardless of personnel

### "Mesh" - Crossing Concept
**The concept:**
- Two inside receivers: Shallow crossing routes at same depth (creating natural pick/rub)
- Two outside receivers: Vertical routes (clear out coverage)
- RB: Typically releases to flat or runs swing

**QB read:** Same vs. man or zone - finds the open crossing receiver or takes checkdown

**Why it works:** Creates traffic vs. man coverage; finds holes in zone coverage

**When called:** Extremely effective on 3rd and medium (5-8 yards)

### "Y-Sail" - Three Level Concept
**The concept:**
- Y receiver (TE or slot): Deep corner route (15-20 yards)
- Middle level: Intermediate crossing route (10-12 yards)
- Low level: Flat route (2-5 yards)

**QB read:** High-low progression based on coverage rotation

**Why it works:** Puts defenders in conflict; someone is usually open

### "Levels" - Horizontal Stretch
**The concept:**
- Multiple receivers running routes at different depths to same side
- Creates horizontal and vertical stretch simultaneously

**QB read:** Finds the level that defense leaves open

**Variations:** Can be run as "Inside Levels" or "Outside Levels"

### "Snag" - Quick Game Concept
**The concept:**
- Outside receiver: Corner route (to flatten defender)
- Slot receiver: Snag route (5-7 yards, settling in zone)
- RB/Inside: Flat route (immediate option)

**QB read:** Quick decision based on flat defender's action

**When called:** Hot route vs. blitz; quick game on early downs

---

## Play Call Structure

### Complete Play Call Example

**"Trips Right Ghost Alert on 1"**

Breaking it down:
- **Trips Right** = Formation (3 receivers to right side)
- **Ghost** = Concept (3-level flood as described above)
- **Alert** = Protection modification (likely hot route vs. blitz)
- **On 1** = Snap count (ball is snapped on first "hut")

### Simplified In-Game Calls

Once the formation is set, the QB might just call:

**"Ghost! Ghost!"** = Run the Ghost concept from current formation

**"ICE!"** = Specific Patriots concept to the left side

**"PAR!"** = Specific Patriots concept to the right side

This is why Tom Brady could change plays in seconds at the line of scrimmage.

### Two Concepts in One

Advanced E-P implementation: Call two concepts simultaneously for different sides

**Example: "Ghost/Levels"**
- Left side runs Ghost concept
- Right side runs Levels concept
- QB chooses based on defensive alignment

**Advantage:** Maximum flexibility; QB has multiple answers to any defensive look

---

## Game Planning Process

### Off-Season Foundation (January-February)

**Evaluation phase:**
- Review previous season's performance
- Identify what concepts worked/failed
- Decide what to retain, modify, or eliminate
- Install new concepts based on personnel

**Personnel assessment:**
- What are our players' strengths?
- Which concepts maximize their abilities?
- What limitations must we work around?

### Training Camp (July-August)

**Concept installation:**
- Install 15-20 core concepts that form the offensive foundation
- Practice each concept from multiple formations
- Develop tags and adjustments for each concept
- Build QB-receiver timing and chemistry

### Weekly Game Planning (In-Season)

**Tuesday-Wednesday: Game Plan Development**

1. **Opponent study** (Monday night into Tuesday)
   - Defensive tendencies by down/distance
   - Coverage preferences (Cover 1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - Blitz packages and frequencies
   - Personnel groupings they use
   - Specific weaknesses to exploit

2. **Play selection** (Tuesday-Wednesday)
   - Select 30-35 plays from the season playbook
   - These are the concepts most likely to succeed vs. this opponent
   - The 60-65 plays run on Sunday will come from this group

3. **"Openers" or "Priority Plays"**
   - 20 scripted plays for normal down-and-distance
   - These are the first 15-20 plays of the game (though not always run in order)
   - Purpose: Set up play-action, establish tempo, test defensive responses

4. **Situational packages**
   - 3rd down plays (broken into short/medium/long subcategories)
   - Red zone plays (High Red, Low Red, Goal Line)
   - Two-minute drill plays
   - Short yardage/goal line
   - Trick plays (typically 2-3 per game)

**Practice Schedule:**
- **Monday:** Base plays and trick plays
- **Tuesday:** Constraint plays (counters to what defense might do to stop base plays)
- **Wednesday:** Blitz beaters, 3rd/4th down, Red Zone
- **Thursday:** Simulated game situations
- **Friday:** Quick review, walk-through

## Call Sheet Organization

### Physical Layout

NFL play-call sheets are typically organized by **down and distance** because certain plays are designed for certain situations.

**Typical sections:**

1. **First Down Plays** (1st & 10)
   - 5-7 runs
   - 5-7 passes
   - 2-3 play-action passes

2. **Second Down** (subdivided)
   - 2nd & short (1-3 yards): Runs and play-action
   - 2nd & medium (4-7 yards): Balanced selection
   - 2nd & long (8+ yards): Primarily passes

3. **Third Down** (most detailed section)
   - 3rd & short (1-3 yards): Power runs, QB sneaks, quick passes
   - 3rd & medium (4-7 yards): High-percentage concepts (Mesh, Snag, etc.)
   - 3rd & long (8+ yards): Aggressive passing concepts

4. **Red Zone**
   - High Red (+25 to +15)
   - Low Red (+14 to +5)
   - Goal Line (+4 to end zone)

5. **Two-Minute / Hurry-Up**
   - Clock-stopping plays (sideline routes, spikes)
   - High-percentage completions
   - Plays that can be run quickly

6. **Special Situations**
   - 4th down conversions
   - 2-point conversions
   - Trick plays

### Visual Organization

Coaches use color coding, boxes, and sections to quickly find plays:

- **Green highlighting:** Best plays vs. this specific opponent
- **Red highlighting:** Plays to avoid based on opponent's strength
- **Boxes:** Priority plays/openers
- **Side notes:** Personnel grouping, formation, coverage to expect

## Teams Using Erhardt-Perkins (2024-2025)

### Confirmed E-P Teams

**Chicago Bears (2025)**
- New head coach Ben Johnson installed E-P system
- Described as "Erhardt-Perkins and West Coast hybrid"
- Benefits QB Caleb Williams with simplified reads

**Historical Users**

**New England Patriots (2000-2023)**
- The modern blueprint for E-P dominance
- Bill Belichick and Tom Brady perfected the system over 20 years
- Patriots moved to West Coast system in 2024 under new OC Alex Van Pelt

**Other Current/Recent Users:**
- Teams with coaches from the Belichick coaching tree often use E-P or modified versions
- Many teams use hybrid approaches incorporating E-P concepts

### Why Teams Are Adopting E-P

1. **Pace of modern game:** No-huddle and hurry-up offenses require quick communication
2. **Quarterback development:** Easier for young QBs to learn concepts vs. memorizing hundreds of plays
3. **Personnel flexibility:** Modern offenses constantly substitute; E-P adapts seamlessly
4. **Pre-snap motion:** Works perfectly with motion trends (used on 25% of NFL snaps in 2024)

---

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages

**1. Communication Speed**
- One or two-word calls vs. lengthy verbiage
- Perfect for no-huddle and two-minute drill
- QB can audible in seconds

**2. Formation Flexibility**
- Same concept works from any formation
- Easy to implement motion and shifts
- Seamless personnel substitutions

- Forces defense to play honest post-snap

### Limitations

**1. Requires Smart Quarterback**
- System works best with QB who can read defenses
- Decision-making responsibility falls heavily on QB
- Young/inexperienced QBs may struggle initially

**2. Receiver Intelligence**
- Receivers must understand concepts, not just routes
- Need to adjust based on coverage
- More thinking required than "just run your route"

**3. Installation Time**
- While individual concepts are simpler, understanding the full system takes time
- Players must learn how each concept adapts to different formations
- May be overwhelming initially for players from different systems

**4. Coordinator Dependency**
- Requires offensive coordinator who truly understands the system
- Not as simple as "call plays off a sheet"
- Game planning becomes more critical

---

## Practical Application

### For Offensive Coordinators

**Building Your Concept Menu:**

Start with 12-15 core concepts:
- 3-4 quick game concepts (Snag, Slants, Spacing)
- 3-4 intermediate concepts (Mesh, Levels, Ghost)
- 2-3 vertical concepts (Four Verts, Sail, Y-Corner)
- 2-3 play-action concepts (Boot, Waggle, Nakeds)
- 2-3 run game concepts (Inside Zone, Outside Zone, Power/Gap)

**Practice each concept from:**
- Multiple formations (Doubles, Trips, Empty, etc.)
- Multiple personnel groupings (11, 12, 21, etc.)
- Multiple alignments (Shotgun, Pistol, Under Center)

**Develop tags for:**
- Protection adjustments (Alert, Max, Slide, etc.)
- Route adjustments (Speed, Spot, Settle, etc.)
- Assignment changes (Switch, Swap, etc.)

### For Quarterbacks

**Mastering E-P as a QB:**

1. **Learn the core concepts**
   - Understand the purpose of each concept
   - Know why it works vs. man and zone
   - Recognize which defensive looks it attacks

2. **Study formations**
   - Know how each concept looks from different formations
   - Understand how personnel changes affect the concept
   - Recognize who has which assignment in each formation

3. **Develop pre-snap process**
   - Identify defensive structure (1-high or 2-high safety)
   - Recognize coverage indicators (corners' alignment)
   - Spot potential blitzers
   - Choose the right concept for the defensive look

4. **Post-snap progressions**
   - Each concept has a built-in read progression
   - Trust the concept - someone will be open
   - Don't force it; take checkdown when appropriate

### For Players Learning the System

**Mental Framework:**

Instead of thinking: "On this play, I run an 8-yard out"

Think: "On Ghost concept from this alignment, I'm the middle receiver, so I run the intermediate route which is an 8-yard out. If we run Ghost from a different formation where I'm outside, I run the vertical route."

**Keys to Success:**
- Focus on learning concepts, not plays
- Understand WHY the concept works
- Know your role in each concept from different alignments
- Communicate with QB about coverage adjustments

---

## Real-World Example: Game Situation

**Scenario:** 2nd & 7 from opponent's 35-yard line, middle of 2nd quarter

**Offensive coordinator's thought process:**

1. **Down and distance:** 2nd & medium - need 4+ yards to set up manageable 3rd down
2. **Field position:** Plus territory but not red zone - all concepts available
3. **Defensive tendency:** This opponent plays Cover 3 on 2nd & medium 65% of the time
4. **Game plan:** "Levels" concept has been effective vs. their Cover 3

**Play call:** "Trips Right Levels on 2"

**What happens:**

- Formation: Trips Right tells receivers to align with 3 to the right
- Concept: Levels - receivers run layered routes at different depths to the right
- QB read: Identifies Cover 3 pre-snap (1 high safety, corners at depth)
- Post-snap: Finds the intermediate crossing route open between underneath and deep zones
- Result: 9-yard completion, 1st down

**Why E-P made this easy:**
- Simple call: Just three words plus cadence
- QB knew pre-snap this concept should work vs. Cover 3
- Receivers knew exactly what to do from Trips alignment
- If defense had shown blitz, QB could have called "Snag" instead in seconds

---

## Conclusion

The Erhardt-Perkins system has become the dominant play-calling methodology in modern NFL football because it solves the fundamental challenge facing offenses: how to communicate complex plays quickly while maintaining maximum flexibility.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Concepts, not plays:** The system organizes football around 15-20 core concepts rather than hundreds of individual plays

2. **Formation flexibility:** Each concept works from any formation, personnel grouping, or alignment

3. **Communication efficiency:** One or two-word calls enable no-huddle offense and quick adjustments

4. **Quarterback empowerment:** Smart QBs thrive because they can choose the right concept for any defensive look

5. **Modern necessity:** As the NFL becomes faster and more complex, E-P provides the structure teams need to execute at the highest level

Whether you're a coach considering implementing this system, a player trying to learn it, or a fan wanting to understand what you're watching, the Erhardt-Perkins system represents the evolution of offensive football - combining simplicity of communication with complexity of execution.
