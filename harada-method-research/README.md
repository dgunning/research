## History and Origins

### The Founder: Takashi Harada

Takashi Harada developed this method in the 1990s while working as a track and field coach at one of the worst high schools in the most deprived neighborhood of Osaka, Japan. The school's athletic program was struggling, and students had little hope for improvement.

**Remarkable Transformation**:
- Within 3 years: 13 students won gold medals in local championships
- Students became the best athletes at their age level in all of Japan
- The school went from worst to #1 out of 380 schools in Osaka
- This #1 ranking was maintained for 12 consecutive years
- Students also showed dramatic academic improvements

### Norman Bodek's Role

Norman Bodek, known as the "Godfather of Lean," discovered the Harada Method on his 75th trip to Japan. Bodek was:
- President of PCS Inc. and founder of Productivity Press (1979)
- Author and publisher of over 250 books on management, productivity, quality, and Lean manufacturing
- Instrumental in bringing Japanese manufacturing methods to Western audiences

Bodek recognized the Harada Method as "the human side to Lean" and worked with Takashi Harada to develop and promote the method internationally. Together, they co-authored "The Harada Method: The Spirit of Self-Reliance."

### Evolution and Spread

The method has evolved from its origins in Japanese athletics to become a global framework used in:
- Manufacturing (Toyota, lean organizations)
- Education (Portland State University, primary schools)
- Professional sports
- Healthcare institutions
- Technology firms
- Personal development

---

## Core Philosophy and Principles

### Self-Reliance

The essence of the Harada Method is **self-reliance**: the ability of each person to become highly skilled at some discipline—to be the absolute best at something.

Key aspects of self-reliance:
- Focus on independence and discipline
- Personal responsibility for growth
- Making individuals "virtually irreplaceable" through skill development
- Building internal motivation rather than relying on external pressure

### The Four Pillars

The Harada Method is built around four key pillars:

1. **Long-term Vision**: Clearly defined, meaningful objectives aligned with personal values
2. **Daily Tasks**: Breaking ambitious goals into manageable, actionable daily steps
3. **Habit Formation**: Building consistent routines that support goal achievement
4. **Reflective Feedback**: Regular self-assessment and continuous improvement

### The Four Focus Areas

The method addresses development in four interconnected areas:

1. **Spirit**: Mental attitude, motivation, enthusiasm, focus
2. **Skill**: Technical abilities, knowledge, work competencies
3. **Physical Condition**: Health, diet, exercise, energy management
4. **Daily Life**: Personal relationships, time management, independence

---

## The Five Forms System

The Harada Method uses five interconnected forms that create a comprehensive system for self-reliance:

### 1. The 33 Questions for Self-Reliance

**Purpose**: Initial self-assessment to gauge current levels of self-reliance

**Structure**:
- 33 personality traits related to self-reliance
- Three-column format:
  1. The trait to evaluate
  2. Self-rating on a scale of 1-10 (10 being highest)
  3. Space to write improvement plans

**Question Categories**:
1. Preparation, Self-Evaluation, Imaging, and Problem Identification and Solution
2. Motivation
3. Creativity
4. Human Talent, Relationship, Self-Control, Generating Motivation, and Leadership

**Use**: Identifies which descriptors need improvement (e.g., knowledge, skilled work, time management, independence)

### 2. Long-Term Goal Form

**Purpose**: The core of the Harada Method; documents your ultimate objective

**Key Features**:
- One-page declaration of your primary goal
- Includes sensory details (what you'll see, hear, and feel upon success)
- Makes the goal emotionally compelling
- Without documentation, commitment is difficult

**Focus**: Clarifying concrete, meaningful objectives aligned with personal values and identifying the powerful "why" motivating the journey

### 3. Open Window 64 Chart (OW64)

**Purpose**: Break ambitious long-term goals into manageable, actionable daily tasks

**Structure**:
- 9×9 grid = 81 total cells
- Center cell: Your ultimate long-term goal
- 8 surrounding cells: Key focus areas supporting the main goal
- Each of those 8 areas expanded into 8 sub-tasks = 64 total action items

**Also Known As**: Mandala Chart (especially in the context of Shohei Ohtani's usage)

*Detailed explanation in dedicated section below*

### 4. Routine Check Sheet

**Purpose**: Building and changing habits through daily tracking

**Structure**:
- Daily checklist to strengthen habits
- Should NOT include more than 10 tasks
- Developed based on the 64 tasks identified in the OW64 chart
- Uses tracking marks (1 for completed, 0 for not completed, or checkmarks)
- Typically shows daily columns for an entire month
- Includes subtotals and percentage calculations for goal achievement

**Key Principle**: Consistency over perfection—track your progress to maintain momentum

### 5. Daily Diary

**Purpose**: Planning, time tracking, reflection, and learning using the spirit of deliberate practice

**Format Sections**:

1. **Time Planning**:
   - Time slots from 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM (midnight)
   - Columns for Plan, Actual, and Reflections

2. **Daily Tasks and Reflections**:
   - Top 5 Tasks for Today
   - Today's Phrase (inspiring words/quotes)
   - Inspiring words/phrases/events
   - Challenges and good things noticed today
   - Questions for Mentor/Coach
   - "What would you do differently?"

3. **Self-Assessment Areas** (Scored 1-5 each):
   - **Mental**: Enthusiasm, focus
   - **Body**: Diet, exercise
   - **Work**: Skill improvements
   - **Relations**: Work with others
   - **Life**: Personal life
   - **Learning**: Self-study
   - **Routines**: Did many or few
   - **Overall impression of day**

**Core Concept**: "Future Thinking"—regularly think about what you want to achieve in the future, then work backwards to determine what you need to do in the present

---

## The Open Window 64 Chart (OW64)

### Detailed Structure

The OW64 Chart (also called the Mandala Chart or 64-Chart) is the most distinctive tool of the Harada Method.

**The Mathematics**:
- 1 central goal
- 8 key focus areas = 8 cells
- Each focus area broken into 8 sub-tasks = 8 × 8 = 64 tasks
- Total structure: 9×9 grid = 81 cells (1 center + 8 focus areas + 64 tasks)

**Visual Layout**:
```
[Sub-task grid] [Sub-task grid] [Sub-task grid]
[Sub-task grid] [MAIN GOAL]    [Sub-task grid]
[Sub-task grid] [Sub-task grid] [Sub-task grid]
```

Each of the 8 surrounding grids contains:
```
[Task] [Task] [Task]
[Task] [Focus Area] [Task]
[Task] [Task] [Task]
```

### How to Create Your OW64 Chart

**Step 1: Define Your Main Goal**
- Write your ultimate long-term goal in the center cell
- Be specific and inspiring
- Make it meaningful to you personally

**Step 2: Identify 8 Key Focus Areas**
- Determine the 8 main areas that will support your central goal
- These should represent different aspects required for success
- Write one in each of the 8 cells surrounding your main goal

**Step 3: Break Down Each Focus Area**
- For each of the 8 focus areas, identify 8 specific tasks or sub-goals
- These should be concrete, actionable items
- Expand each focus area into its own 3×3 grid

**Step 4: Integrate with Daily Practice**
- Use the Routine Check Sheet to track daily progress on key tasks
- Use the Daily Diary to plan and reflect on your actions
- Regularly review and update your chart as you progress

### Example: Shohei Ohtani's Approach

At age 15, baseball player Shohei Ohtani created his first OW64 Chart with the goal of becoming the top MLB draft pick. His chart included:

**Not Just Baseball Skills**:
- Technical baseball abilities (pitching, hitting)
- Physical conditioning
- Mental preparation

**Personal Development**:
- Being caring and well-mannered
- Reading more books
- Thinking positively
- Building good character

This holistic approach—addressing both professional skills and personal growth—is a hallmark of the Harada Method. Ohtani has created approximately 15 OW64 charts throughout his career, updating them as his goals evolved.

### Final Thoughts

The Harada Method represents a powerful framework for personal development, with an impressive track record spanning athletics, business, and education. While it lacks rigorous academic validation, its practical results—from transforming the worst school in Osaka to producing a baseball phenomenon like Shohei Ohtani—speak to its effectiveness when properly implemented.

The method's greatest strength is its comprehensive nature: it doesn't just tell you to set goals, but provides a complete system for achieving them through daily discipline, habit formation, and continuous reflection. The integration of the five forms creates a self-reinforcing cycle of goal-setting, action, tracking, and reflection.

However, the Harada Method is not a magic solution. It requires genuine commitment, consistent daily practice, and often benefits from coaching or mentorship. It's a marathon, not a sprint—designed for those willing to invest time and effort in long-term transformation rather than seeking quick wins.

For those willing to embrace its structure and commit to daily practice, the Harada Method offers a proven path to developing self-reliance, building valuable skills, and achieving ambitious long-term goals. The question is not whether the method works—the evidence suggests it does—but whether you're prepared to put in the work required to make it work for you.
