# Research Notes: Harada Method

## Initial Prompt
"I want to know everything about the Harada method of learning new skills"

## Research Log

### Session Start
- Created project folder: harada-method-research
- Beginning comprehensive research on the Harada method

### Research Findings - History and Origins

**Creator**: Takashi Harada
- Started as athletics coach at worst high school in Osaka, Japan
- Within 3 years: 13 students won gold medals in local championships
- School became #1 out of 380 schools in Osaka for 12 consecutive years
- Students also showed dramatic academic improvements

**Norman Bodek's Role**:
- American consultant who discovered the method on his 75th trip to Japan
- President of PCS Inc., founded Productivity Press in 1979
- Published over 250 books on Lean manufacturing
- Helped develop and promote the Harada Method internationally
- Positioned it as "the human side to Lean"

### Core Philosophy

**Self-Reliance**: The ability of each person to become highly skilled at some discipline
- Focus on independence and discipline
- Personal responsibility for growth
- Making individuals "virtually irreplaceable" through skill development

### The Five Forms System

1. **Self-Evaluation Form** - Initial assessment
2. **Long-Term Goal Form** - Setting primary objectives
3. **Open Window 64 Chart (OW64/Mandala Chart)** - Goal breakdown
4. **Routine Check Sheet** - Daily habit tracking (max 10 tasks)
5. **Daily Diary** - Planning and reflection tool

### The Open Window 64 Chart (OW64)

**Structure**:
- 9x9 grid = 81 cells
- Center cell: Ultimate long-term goal
- 8 surrounding cells: Key focus areas supporting the main goal
- Each of those 8 expanded into 8 sub-tasks = 64 total action items

**Purpose**: Break ambitious goals into manageable, actionable daily tasks

### Notable Success: Shohei Ohtani

- Created first OW64 chart at age 15 (high school sophomore)
- Goal: Become top MLB draft pick
- Included not just baseball skills but also:
  - Being caring and well-mannered
  - Reading more books
  - Thinking positively
- Has created approximately 15 OW64 charts throughout his career
- Method credited as significant factor in his success as two-way player

### Business Applications

**Toyota Connection**:
- Meshes perfectly with Lean, Six Sigma, and Hoshin Planning
- Gives substance to Toyota's "Respect for People" principle
- Each Toyota factory became self-reliant
- Every worker develops self-reliance

**Results**:
- Case studies show 20-40% uptick in goal attainment
- Lean management studies: up to 30% productivity boost
- One manufacturing firm: 15% waste reduction through employee-led improvements
- Sharper focus and reduced burnout reported

### Key Principles

- **Routine Check Sheet**: Daily checklist (max 10 tasks) to strengthen habits
- **Daily Diary**: Time tracking, reflection, and learning using deliberate practice
- **Four Pillars**: Long-term vision, daily tasks, habit formation, reflective feedback
- **Incremental Progress**: Building structured routine around measurable actions

### Detailed Implementation Guide

**Step-by-Step 7-Day Quick Start**:
1. **Day 1 - Define Your North Star**: Spend 30 minutes writing your long-term goal, being specific
2. **Day 2 - Map Your Open Windows**: List 10-15 key tasks that ladder up to your goal and slot the top three into your 64-window grid
3. **Days 3-4 - Build Your Daily Routine**: Design a 10-minute morning ritual—review your goal, scan your windows, and commit to three actions
4. **Day 5 - Incorporate Weekly Check-Ins**: Set a Sunday slot to score your progress (1-10 scale) and tweak as needed

**Full Process**:
1. Identify a skill you want to master
2. Identify at least 10 different variations of that goal
3. Ask family, friends, and colleagues for their suggestions
4. Analyze the pros and cons of each variation
5. Pick one goal and set a timeframe to achieve it
6. Split this goal into sub-steps and set dates for intermediate goals
7. Split these sub-steps into even smaller goals with shorter timeframes

### The 33 Questions for Self-Reliance

**Purpose**: Gauges how self-reliant the individual is
**Format**:
- Rate yourself on a scale of 1-10 against each of 33 questions
- Three columns:
  1. The 33 traits to grade yourself on
  2. Number grade (1-10, with 10 being highest)
  3. Space to jot down what you would do to improve your score

**Categories**: Questions grouped into 4 main categories:
1. Preparation, Self-Evaluation, Imaging, and Problem Identification and Solution
2. Motivation
3. Creativity
4. Human Talent, Relationship, Self-Control, Generating Motivation, and Leadership

**Focus Areas**: Spirit, skill, physical condition, and daily life

### Long-Term Goal Form

**Purpose**: Core of the Harada method; documents goals
- Without documentation, commitment is difficult
- One-page declaration of your ultimate objective
- Includes sensory details (what you'll see, hear, and feel upon success)
- Makes the goal emotionally compelling

### Routine Check Sheet

**Structure**:
- Daily checklist to strengthen habits
- Developed based on the 64 tasks identified in OW64 chart
- Should NOT include more than 10 tasks
- Uses tracking marks (1 for completed, 0 for not completed, or checkmarks)
- Shows daily columns for entire month
- Includes subtotals and percentage calculations for goal achievement

**Purpose**: Building and changing habits

### Daily Diary

**Format Sections**:
1. **Time Planning**:
   - Time slots from 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM
   - Columns for Plan, Actual, and Reflections

2. **Daily Tasks**:
   - Top 5 Tasks for Today
   - Today's Phrase
   - Inspiring words/phrases/events
   - Challenges and good things noticed today
   - Questions for Mentor/Coach
   - "What would you do differently?"

3. **Self-Assessment Areas** (Scored 1-5 each):
   - Mental: Enthusiasm, focus
   - Body: Diet, exercise
   - Work: Skill improvements
   - Relations: Work with others
   - Life: Personal life
   - Learning: Self-study
   - Routines: Did many or few
   - Overall impression of day

**Purpose**:
- Planning tool to organize each day
- Similar to a to-do list
- Helps plan days to meet ultimate goal
- Tracking time, reflection, and learning
- Deliberate practice review
- "Future Thinking" - work backwards from future goals to determine present actions

### Educational Implementation

**Classroom Applications**:
- Successfully taught at Portland State University
- Used with primary school students

- Tools: 64-Chart, Daily Diary, Routine Check

**Original Context**:
- Developed in 1990s while coaching middle school track team
- Focus on discipline, goal-setting, and daily routines

### Limitations and Challenges

**Acknowledged Challenges**:
1. Requires dedication, effort, and time
2. Implementation difficulties - finding rhythm in application
3. Not a complete solution for all aspects of personal growth
4. May seem like a long and detailed process
5. Works despite imperfect implementation

**Evidence Gap**:
- Dominated by promotional sources (official websites, training materials, consulting firms)
- Lack of peer-reviewed research or academic critiques
- Limited independent scholarly evaluation
- Evidence primarily from case studies and testimonials rather than controlled scientific experiments

### Comparison with Other Goal-Setting Systems

**Harada Method vs. SMART Goals**:
- **Timeframe**: SMART for shorter, time-bound achievements; Harada for long-term self-improvement
- **Focus**: SMART on goal structure (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound); Harada on habit formation and self-reliance
- **Scope**: SMART provides guidelines for writing goals; Harada provides comprehensive system

**Harada Method vs. OKRs**:
- **Level**: OKRs for organizational/team level alignment; Harada for individual growth
- **Ambition**: OKRs aspirational and challenging; Harada achievable with discipline
- **Flexibility**: OKRs allow pivoting; Harada has rigid structure in daily routines
- **Adaptability**: OKRs more adaptive in fast-paced environments; Harada emphasizes consistency

**Summary**: Harada emphasizes self-reliance and daily habit formation (ideal for long-term personal development), while SMART goals and OKRs are more goal-outcome focused

### The 20 Structured Steps

The method operates through 20 structured steps, emphasizing:
- Accountability through coaching
- Daily documentation
- Regular measurement
- Continuous adjustment

Success depends on:
- Self-reliance
- Discipline
- Peer or mentor guidance throughout the process
