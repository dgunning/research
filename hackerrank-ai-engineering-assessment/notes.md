2. HackerRank Online Assessment
3. Technical Interview Rounds (3-4 rounds)
   - DS/Algo coding problems
   - ML case studies
   - System design
   - Behavioral questions
4. Hiring Committee & Offer

#### Specific Problem Examples
- Circular Printer problem (mentioned in LeetCode discussions)
- String manipulation and sorting
- Timestamp grouping
- Trigram language models
- Gradient boosting implementation
- System design questions

### Company Context
- Thomson Reuters is "rolling out agentic AI"
- Company prioritizes engineers with AI/ML skills
- $150 million venture fund for legal tech, compliance, and media innovation
- Focus on transparency, data integrity, and Trust Principles

### HackerRank Assessment Level System
HackerRank offers skills certifications and assessments at three levels:
- **Basic**: Covers fundamental topics (e.g., Arrays, Strings, basic Sorting and Searching)
- **Intermediate**: Covers HashMaps, Stacks, Queues, and optimal solutions
- **Advanced**: Covers hard difficulty questions and advanced concepts

**Note**: The "1a" designation in "AI Engineering 1a" is not found in public HackerRank documentation. It may be:
- A company-specific internal designation
- A custom assessment created by Thomson Reuters
- A reference to an entry-level or foundational AI engineering role

### Salary Information (Thomson Reuters ML/AI Roles)
- Entry-level MLEs: ~$122,000–$145,000 USD annually
- Mid-level: ~$145,000
- Senior positions: May exceed $170,000 depending on location and bonus structure

### Preparation Recommendations
Based on multiple sources, candidates should:
1. Practice medium to hard LeetCode problems
2. Focus on data structures: arrays, strings, hash maps, graphs, stacks, queues
3. For AI/ML roles: Review ML fundamentals (precision/recall, feature engineering, model evaluation)
4. For coding questions: Emphasize clean, readable code
5. Practice explaining thought process aloud
6. Simulate timed practice conditions (typically 45-90 minutes)
7. For ML case studies: Think end-to-end (problem → data → model → metrics → deployment)

### Modern AI Engineering Topics (2025)
HackerRank's April 2025 release includes:
- **Prompt Engineering**: 7 questions with automated scoring, testing clarity, iterative refinement, context management
- **RAG Systems**: VS Code-style environment, testing architecture design, chunking strategies, embedding models, vector DB querying
- **LLM Skills**: Transformer architectures, fine-tuning, zero-shot/few-shot learning, Chain-of-Thought prompting
- **AI-Assisted IDE**: Real-time AI collaboration, usage transcripts, activity playback

Difficulty distribution recommended: 30% beginner, 50% intermediate, 20% advanced

### Research Conclusions

**Main Findings**:
1. "TR" = Thomson Reuters (confirmed)
2. "AI Engineering 1a" - No public information found for this specific designation
3. Likely a custom/internal assessment name used by Thomson Reuters
4. "1a" could indicate entry-level or first-stage assessment
5. "Prod Eng" may refer to Production Engineering focus (MLOps, deployment, infrastructure)

**What's NOT publicly available**:
- No specific details about "AI Engineering 1a" assessment
- No "Prod Eng" specific information for Thomson Reuters
- Limited recent (2024-2025) candidate experience reports for AI roles

**Best preparation approach**:
- Cover broad base: algorithms, ML fundamentals, modern AI (RAG/LLM/prompt engineering)
- Practice on HackerRank platform to familiarize with environment
- Focus on clean code, communication, and end-to-end thinking
- Ask recruiter for specific details if possible
